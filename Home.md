A Newton disc is a physics experiment with a rotating disc with segments in different colours. The colours are usually the primary
 colours of the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Each colour occupies the same space as its corresponding colour in the 
spectrum. When the disc is rapidly rotated, the colours fuse and appear as white or grey. The disc is named after Isaac Newton, who studied the nature
 of light and colour

Newton’s disc, also known as the Newton wheel, is a colorful science experiment that demonstrates how the human eye perceives colors. It’s an excellent project for kids and adults alike. In this article, we’ll walk you through the steps to make your very own DIY Newton’s disc.

Step 1: Gather Materials

You’ll need the following materials:

– A blank CD or DVD

– Colored markers (preferably in the primary and secondary colors)

– A black marker

– A string or rubber band

Step 2: Clean the Disc

Make sure to clean the CD or DVD before you start drawing on it. Use a soft cloth to wipe away any dirt or fingerprints.

Step 3: Mark the Center

Use a black marker to make a small dot in the center of the CD or DVD. This will be the axis around which your Newton disc will spin.

Step 4: Divide into Sections

Divide the disc into six equal sections by drawing six straight lines from the outer edge to the center dot, creating a pie-like pattern.

Step 5: Color Each Section

Take your colored markers and color each section with one of the primary and secondary colors (red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, and cyan). Ensure that each section is filled in completely.

Step 6: Create Spinners

Poke a hole through the center of your disc using a sharp object like a pin or needle. You may need an adult’s assistance in this step.

Step 7: Attach String/Rubber Band

Thread a string through the hole you created earlier, making sure it goes through both sides of the hole. Alternatively, attach a rubber band on either side of the disc by looping it through itself. Make sure it’s tight enough so that it doesn’t slip when spinning.

Step 8: Prepare Spinning Area

Find a suitable area to comfortably spin your Newton disc, ensuring that there’s enough space for the spinning motion and that it’s clear of any fragile items or decorations.

Step 9: Hold on to the Spinners

Grip the string or rubber band tightly with both hands. Position one hand at the top of the string and the other at the bottom, maintaining a few inches of space between them.

Step 10: Wind Up

Twist the string or rubber band by turning the CD/DVD in one direction. The more you twist it, the faster your Newton disc will spin.

Step 11: Release for Spinning

Let go of your grip on the bottom hand, allowing the disc to start spinning. As it unwinds, grasp it again, maintaining tension in your top hand. This will allow it to spin in reverse and wind up again. Repeat this process several times.

Step 12: Observe Color Combination

As your Newton disc spins, you’ll notice that the distinct colors begin to merge and appear white or gray. This phenomenon is due to how our eyes perceive rapidly changing colors. The faster the disc spins, the more blurred the colors become.

Now that you know how to make a DIY Newton disc follow these steps and experiment with different color combinations. Enjoy this entertaining science project and explore more about color perception!
